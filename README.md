# RASLite

This repository contains the implementation of the RASLite algorithm for MaxSAT, as proposed in our paper:

RASLite: Enhancing (W)PMS Solvers Through a Dynamic Initial Weight Approach

## Installation

On a Unix/Linux machine, execute the following commands:  

unzip RASLite-main.zip  
cd RASLite-main  
make  

An executable file called RASLite will now be available in the RASLite-main directory.  
To run the algorithm, enter the command `./RASLite instance_name`, to run the algorithm.
