# RASLite

This repository contains the implementation of the RASLite algorithm for MaxSAT, as proposed in our paper:

[RASLite: Enhancing (W)PMS Solvers Through a Dynamic Initial Weight Approach](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10580189)

## Installation

To install and compile RASLite on a Unix/Linux machine, execute the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jmhmaxsat/RASLite.git  
cd RASLite
make
```

After compilation, an executable file named RASLite will be available in the RASLite directory.
To run the algorithm, use the following command: `./RASLite instance_name`.
